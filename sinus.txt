Maa Das - Neti pot, but in addition to salt add xylitol to the water - twice as much xylitol as salt. 
I once had an antibiotic-resistant sinus chronic sinus infection, did this twice a day (for about 30 days I think).
This cleared the infection and haven’t had any problems since then that couldn’t be easily cleared with one or two neti pots. 
And that’s after about 30 years of sinus issues.
